    <!--
        This is known as Internal Script, it can be added to the head or body of an HTML file
        It is preferred to be put into the body rather than the head, though
    -->
    <script>
        console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript! This can only be seen in the console log')
      </script>

    <!--
        We can also place external scripts in either the head or body, but body is preferred
        Like with internal, we need to use the script tags
        src is source
        Source = ourfilename.js
    -->
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
    <script src="./helloworld.js"></script>


  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!')">Click Me</button>
    <!-- 
        Note that this INLINE SCRIPT Javascript being added, meaning it is embedded within the HTML
        syntax of a button to click
    button onclick, then create an alert with text inside
    between the button tags is where the page html text shows up...
    Note that the syntax on Chrome is as follows:
    Website name says... alert text-->
    <button onclick ="alert('Welcome to my new alert!')">Click the new alert!</button>
    
    <!-- this is internal scripting in the body-->
    <script>
        console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript, in the body')
      </script>


    <!-- Before the closing tag of the body is the recommended place to put the external JavaScript script 
    When using multiple external files, 
    Your main.js file should be below all other scripts
    NOTE: you can see which file is being run on the chrome console for each console output!
