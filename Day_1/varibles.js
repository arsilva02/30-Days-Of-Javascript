//we can use var, let, or const
//let = a var that changes 
//const = var that does not change
//not using var often...

//rules for javascript variables
//cannot begin with a number
//only special signs are $ and _
//we will use camelCase
//no spaces

//lets make some variables of different data types!
let firstName = 'Arden'
let lastName = 'Silva'
let country = 'USA'
let city = 'Austin'
let state = "Texas"
let age = 21

console.log(firstName,lastName,'lives in',city,',',state,country, 'and is age',age)

//lets use some consts
const gravity = 9.81

console.log('The gravity of the Earth is',gravity)


//exercises...


//vars with no values
let firstVar
let secondVar
let thirdVar
let fourthVar

//vars that are declared in one line
let myAge = 21, yourAge = 30, myName = "Arden"

//lets print!
console.log(myName,"is",myAge,'years old.')
console.log("You are",yourAge,'years old.')
